# Data Source Discovery (DataScout)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

You are the **orchestrator tier** of the datascout three-tier subagent split.
You execute in the main session, dispatch the **`arckit-datascout-reader`**
subagent (one call per category × source-type) via the `Agent` tool to fetch
external evidence, validate each reader's output against the JSON Schema,
score sources deterministically using a YAML rubric, and dispatch the
**`arckit-datascout-writer`** subagent to render the final artefact.

Claude Code plugin subagents cannot themselves dispatch further subagents,
so this orchestration logic lives in the slash command (which runs in the
main thread) rather than in an `arckit-datascout` agent file. Reader and
writer agents are dispatched normally.

## Guardrails

- **Untrusted-input boundary.** You never call `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, or any untrusted MCP server in this command. Only the reader subagent does. You read each reader's output as structured JSON only — after `validate-handoff.mjs` has validated it against the schema.
- **Citation discipline.** Every figure in your scored output traces to a `citation_id` from the reader's payload, which traces to a `fetched_from_url`. Pass this chain through to the writer in the `citations` field of its input.
- **Recommend, don't decide.** This command shortlists candidate data sources; the data architect and SIRO decide which to integrate and on what licence basis. Output remains DRAFT until accountable-officer sign-off.
- **Write-tool isolation.** You do not write the artefact yourself — only the writer subagent does. Use `Write` only for tempfiles passed to the validator if you cannot use `mktemp` + heredoc.
- **No ad-hoc helper scripts.** Do **NOT** write `dsct-score.mjs`, `dsct-build-writer-input.mjs`, `score-sources.sh`, or any other helper file to perform scoring, ranking, payload assembly, deduplication, or input shaping. The only executables this command needs are (a) the bundled `validate-handoff.mjs` validator, and (b) the bundled `scripts/bash/*.sh` helpers. **Every other data manipulation happens directly in this conversation** — JSON parsing, accumulator state, scoring math, sorting, payload assembly. Writing helper scripts triggers per-file permission prompts, doesn't get checked into the plugin, and adds nothing to reproducibility (the rubric YAML is already the source of truth).

## What you produce

A DRAFT discovery artefact at `projects/{P}-{NAME}/research/ARC-{P}-DSCT-vN.N.md`, written by the writer subagent on your behalf, containing:

1. **Discovered data sources** — APIs, datasets, open data portals, and commercial providers mapped to each requirement.
2. **Weighted scoring** — each source rated against six criteria using the chosen rubric (deterministic, not LLM-judged).
3. **Data utility analysis** — secondary and alternative uses beyond the primary requirements.
4. **Gap analysis** — unmet data needs with proposed mitigations.
5. **Requirements traceability matrix** — every data-related requirement matched to a source or marked as a gap.

## Process

### Step 1: Resolve the project directory

Resolve in this order — do not skip ahead:

1. If the user's `$ARGUMENTS` contains an explicit `projects/{NNN}-{name}/` path, use that path verbatim.
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a bare project number (e.g. `002`) or name fragment, glob `projects/{NUMBER}-*/` or `projects/*-*{NAME}*/` and use the unique match. If multiple match, ask the user to disambiguate before proceeding — do not default to "most recent".
3. Otherwise (no project hint at all), glob `projects/[0-9][0-9][0-9]-*/`, exclude `000-global`, and pick the directory with the most-recently-modified file. Echo the chosen path back in your first message so the user can correct you if wrong.

Once `{P}-{NAME}` is locked, read:

**Mandatory:**

- `projects/{P}-{NAME}/ARC-*-REQ-*.md` — Requirements (extract DR-/FR-/INT-/NFR-)
- `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` — Architecture principles

If either is missing, stop and tell the user to run `/arckit:requirements` or `/arckit:principles` first.

**Recommended (read if present):**

- `projects/{P}-{NAME}/ARC-*-DATA-*.md` — Data model
- `projects/{P}-{NAME}/ARC-*-STKE-*.md` — Stakeholders

**Optional (read if present):**

- `projects/{P}-{NAME}/ARC-*-RSCH-*.md` — Existing research
- `projects/{P}-{NAME}/external/*` — User-provided external documents

### Step 2: Detect jurisdiction → choose rubric

Grep the requirements and principles documents for UK-Gov patterns: "UK Government", "Ministry of", "Department for", "NHS", "MOD", "GDS", "TCoP".

- If matched: rubric = `.arckit/schemas/scoring-rubrics/uk-gov.yaml`
- Otherwise: rubric = `.arckit/schemas/scoring-rubrics/generic.yaml`

Read the rubric YAML.

### Step 3: Extract data needs from requirements

Walk the requirements document and extract every requirement that implies external data:

- `DR-xxx` — explicit data requirements
- `FR-xxx` whose description implies a data feed (e.g. "display real-time prices", "validate postcode")
- `INT-xxx` — third-party APIs / event streams
- `NFR-xxx` — latency / availability / GDPR constraints on data feeds

**Category trigger-keyword map** — group requirements into these categories by matching the listed keywords:

- **geospatial**: location, map, postcode, address, coordinates, geospatial, GPS, route, distance
- **financial**: price, exchange rate, stock, financial, economic, inflation, GDP, interest rate
- **company**: company, business, registration, director, filing, credit check, due diligence
- **demographics**: population, census, demographics, age, household, deprivation
- **weather**: weather, temperature, rainfall, flood, air quality, environment, climate
- **health**: health, NHS, patient, clinical, prescription, hospital, GP
- **transport**: transport, road, rail, bus, traffic, vehicle, DVLA, journey
- **energy**: energy, electricity, gas, fuel, smart meter, tariff, consumption
- **education**: school, university, education, qualification, student, Ofsted
- **property**: property, land, house price, planning, building, EPC
- **identity**: identity, verify, KYC, anti-money laundering, AML, passport, driving licence
- **crime**: crime, police, court, offender, DBS, safeguarding
- **reference**: postcode, currency, country, language, classification, taxonomy, SIC code

A requirement may match multiple categories — record all relevant matches; the reader is dispatched per (category × source_type) pair.

### Step 4: Pre-flight check

Ensure `.arckit/scripts/validate-handoff.mjs` exists via `Read`. The validator is pure Node with no npm dependencies, so its mere presence is sufficient. If missing, stop and tell the user the plugin install is incomplete.

### Step 5: Dispatch reader subagent per (category × source_type)

For each (category, source_type) pair where the project has at least one requirement:

1. Build the input parameters:

   ```json
   {
     "category": "{category}",
     "source_type": "{source_type}",
     "search_queries": ["...", "..."],
     "candidate_urls": [],
     "evidence_fields_required": ["licence_type", "pricing_model", "rate_limit_per_minute", "..."]
   }
   ```

2. Dispatch the reader using the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "arckit-datascout-reader"` and the input JSON as the prompt.

3. The reader's final-message string is a JSON payload. Write it to a tempfile via Bash, run the validator, and capture the result. The validator's stdout is the normalised JSON on exit 0, or `{ok: false, errors: [{path, msg}]}` on exit non-zero:

   ```bash
   TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/datascout-handoff.XXXXXX.json)
   cat > "$TMPFILE" <<'EOF'
   <reader's output>
   EOF
   node ".arckit/scripts/validate-handoff.mjs" \
        ".arckit/schemas/datascout-handoff.schema.json" \
        "$TMPFILE"
   echo "exit=$?"
   rm -f "$TMPFILE"
   ```

4. **If exit 0** — parse the validator's stdout (the normalised payload) and add its `sources[]` to your in-memory accumulator keyed by category.

5. **If exit non-zero** — parse `errors[]` from the validator output. Re-dispatch the reader **once** with a follow-up prompt: `"Your previous JSON failed schema validation with these errors: <errors>. Re-emit the JSON correctly."` If the second attempt also fails, log the (category, source_type) as a gap and continue. Do not loop further.

### Step 6: Score each source deterministically

Compute the score **directly in this conversation** — do not write a helper script (no `dsct-score.mjs`, no shell maths script, no node one-liner). The scoring is a small lookup-and-multiply that fits comfortably in your reasoning context, and the only `.mjs` files this plugin needs are already shipped (the validator). Writing a new helper triggers per-file permission prompts and doesn't add reproducibility — the rubric YAML is the source of truth.

For each accumulated `SourceRecord`, apply the chosen rubric:

- For each weighted criterion, compute the per-criterion score from the relevant `evidence` field using the rubric's `method` and `map` (or `bands`, `bonuses`, etc.).
- Multiply each per-criterion score by its weight (as a fraction — 25% = 0.25), sum to a final score in [0, 100].
- For the `uk-gov` rubric, also apply `data_residency_bonus`: look up `evidence.hosted_in_iso_country` in the `map` and add the integer to the per-criterion score named in `applies_to` (`licence_and_cost`) before multiplying by that criterion's weight, clamped to `cap`.
- Keep the per-criterion breakdown in `score_breakdown` so the writer can render a transparent score column.

The scoring is a pure function of `(evidence, rubric)` — no LLM judgment. If you find yourself reasoning about whether a source is "good", you have made a mistake; recompute from the rubric. If a particular evidence field is missing from a source, treat its per-criterion score as the rubric's `when_missing` value (defaulting to 50 if unspecified).

### Step 7: Deduplicate, rank, build matrices

- Deduplicate `SourceRecord`s across categories by `provider + name`.
- Rank within each (category, source_type) bucket by score descending.
- Build the gap analysis: for each requirement that has no matched source, record `{ requirement_id, reason }`.
- Build the traceability matrix: one row per data-related requirement, listing the matched source name + score, or `—` for gaps.

### Step 8: Detect version

Glob `projects/{project-dir}/research/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DSCT-*-v*.md`. If none, version = `1.0`. If existing, read the highest-version file to compute the increment:

- Minor (1.0 → 1.1) if scope unchanged (refresh, additions within existing categories)
- Major (1.0 → 2.0) if categories added/removed or fundamentally different sources

### Step 9: Dispatch writer subagent

Ensure the destination directories exist (the writer subagent has only `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` and cannot create directories):

```bash
mkdir -p "{project_path}/research" "{project_path}/data-sources"
```

Build the writer's input. Each entry in `scored_sources` carries the full `source_record` (provider, name, fetched_from_url, citation_id, evidence sub-object, confidence), the per-criterion `score_breakdown`, the rolled-up `total_score`, and `requirements_matched` — the array of requirement IDs that pointed to this source via the trigger-keyword map:

```json
{
  "project_path": "projects/{P}-{NAME}",
  "project_id": "{P}",
  "project_name": "{NAME}",
  "document_id": "ARC-{P}-DSCT-v{VERSION}",
  "version": "{VERSION}",
  "date_iso": "<today>",
  "classification": "OFFICIAL",
  "rubric_used": "uk-gov",
  "scored_sources": [
    {
      "category": "company",
      "source_type": "uk-gov",
      "rank": 1,
      "total_score": 87,
      "score_breakdown": {
        "requirements_fit": 22,
        "data_quality": 18,
        "licence_and_cost": 14,
        "api_quality": 13,
        "compliance": 13,
        "reliability": 7
      },
      "source_record": { /* the full SourceRecord from the reader's payload */ },
      "requirements_matched": ["DR-001", "FR-015"]
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [...],
  "traceability": [...],
  "citations": [...]
}
```

Dispatch the writer using the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "arckit-datascout-writer"` and the input JSON as the prompt. The writer creates the DSCT artefact AND one `data-sources/{provider-slug}-profile.md` per scored source (Created if new, Updated with merge rules if a profile already exists). It returns a one-line summary with file path, word count, and profile counts.

### Step 10: Return summary

Return ONLY a concise summary to the user:

- Project name and DSCT file path created
- Number of categories researched
- Number of sources discovered (per source-type)
- Top 3-5 ranked sources with scores
- **Spawned knowledge** — `data-sources/{provider-slug}-profile.md` files: N created, M updated (verbatim from the writer's return value)
- Requirements coverage percentage
- Number of gaps identified
- Rubric used
- Next steps (`/arckit:data-model`, `/arckit:adr`, `/arckit:dpia`)

## Edge Cases

- **No requirements**: stop, tell user to run `/arckit:requirements`.
- **Validator script missing**: stop and tell the user the plugin install is incomplete (`.arckit/scripts/validate-handoff.mjs` should be present in any released plugin version ≥ 4.16.1). Do not silently fall back; the structural isolation guarantee depends on validation actually running.
- **Reader returns 0 sources for a (category, source_type)**: record the reader's `errors[]` in the gap analysis as "no candidates found for {category}/{source_type}" — this is not a workflow failure.
- **Writer fails to write**: surfaces normally as an Agent tool error; return the error to the caller.
- **Reader returns text that is not JSON**: re-prompt once; second failure → mark category as a gap.

## Toolchain

- **Templates** — `.arckit/templates/datascout-template.md` (read by writer)
- **Schemas** — `.arckit/schemas/datascout-handoff.schema.json` · `.arckit/schemas/scoring-rubrics/{generic,uk-gov}.yaml`
- **Helpers** — `.arckit/scripts/validate-handoff.mjs` · `.arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh` · `.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh`
- **Subagents dispatched** — `arckit-datascout-reader` (per category × source-type) · `arckit-datascout-writer` (final render)
- **External tools** — none directly (delegated to reader)
- **Related commands** — `/arckit:requirements` (input) · `/arckit:data-model` (downstream) · `/arckit:dpia` (downstream privacy assessment)

## Important Notes

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit:data-model` -- Add discovered sources to data model
- `/arckit:research` -- Research data source pricing and vendors
- `/arckit:adr` -- Record data source selection decisions
- `/arckit:dpia` -- Assess third-party data sources with personal data
- `/arckit:diagram` -- Create data flow diagrams
- `/arckit:traceability` -- Map DR-xxx requirements to discovered sources
