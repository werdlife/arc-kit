> 🪶 **OCAP® notice**: OCAP® is a registered trademark of the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC). The OCAP® principles describe a *relationship*, not a checklist. This template supports — but does not substitute for — direct engagement with FNIGC and the affected First Nation(s), Métis, and Inuit communities.

## Document Control

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |

| [VERSION] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.ca-ocap` | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |

## Executive Summary

[Two to three paragraphs describing the system, the Indigenous data in scope, the FNIGC pre-engagement status, the headline OCAP findings (or that this artefact is a planning scaffold awaiting engagement), and any open items. Name the affected First Nation(s), Métis Nation governing member(s), and Inuit population(s) in scope.]

## FNIGC Pre-Engagement Confirmation

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Engagement booked or in progress? | [yes / no / in progress / N/A — explain] |
| Date of engagement (if scheduled) | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| FNIGC engagement contact | [name, role, email] |
| Community engagement contact(s) | [First Nation(s), Métis Nation governing member(s), Inuit organisation(s) — named contact per nation] |
| Engagement nature | [scoping conversation / data-sharing-agreement workshop / governance review / other] |
| Status | [CONFIRMED / IN PROGRESS / NOT CONFIRMED — PLANNING SCAFFOLD / N/A] |

### Planning Scaffold Mode

- [ ] Engagement NOT confirmed — assessment is a planning scaffold only. Subsequent sections are deferred until engagement.

> **Gate behaviour**: If the box above is ticked, the remaining sections must be left as planning scaffolding only and the artefact header status set to `PLANNING SCAFFOLD — INCOMPLETE`. The architect must engage FNIGC and community representatives before completing this assessment.

#### Engagement Letter Scaffold (used only when engagement is not confirmed)

```text
To: [FNIGC engagement coordinator]
From: [Departmental ADM / accountable signatory]
Subject: OCAP® pre-engagement request — [project / service name]

[Department / agency] is designing [system / service] which will process [brief
description of Indigenous data in scope]. Datasets in scope: [list].
We request a pre-engagement conversation under the FNIGC OCAP® framework
to scope [ownership / control / access / possession] arrangements before
any system design is finalised.

Proposed timeline: [date range].
Departmental contacts: [accountable role + ATIP coordinator + privacy counsel].
```

## Indigenous Data Inventory

| Dataset | First Nation(s) of origin | Data nature | Custodianship | Transfer history | Sensitivity |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| [dataset name / ID] | [First Nation(s) named] | [administrative / statistical / traditional knowledge / biological / image / audio / video] | [community-held / co-held / federal-custodied — describe] | [origin and any prior transfers] | [community-protected / Protected B / Protected C / other — explain] |
| [dataset name / ID] | [First Nation(s) named] | [as above] | [as above] | [as above] | [as above] |

## OCAP Principles Mapping

> Provide one mapping block per dataset listed in the Indigenous Data Inventory.

### Dataset: [dataset name / ID]

#### Ownership

| Aspect | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| Who holds collective ownership | [First Nation(s) / Métis Nation / Inuit organisation] |
| How is ownership asserted | [community resolution, treaty reference, historical record] |
| Supporting agreements | [DSA reference, MOU, treaty article] |

#### Control

| Aspect | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| Decision authority — use | [governance body and decision rule] |
| Decision authority — sharing | [governance body and decision rule] |
| Decision authority — publication | [governance body and decision rule] |
| Decision authority — deletion | [governance body and decision rule] |
| Decision authority — secondary analysis | [governance body and decision rule] |
| Veto rights | [community body holding veto; conditions] |

#### Access

| Aspect | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| Who accesses | [named roles / institutions / researchers] |
| On what terms | [purpose, time-limit, audit obligation] |
| Access tiering | [public / community-only / restricted-research / individual-consent] |
| Consent withdrawal mechanism | [process and SLA] |

#### Possession

| Aspect | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| Physical custody | [where stored, in whose facility] |
| Digital custody | [hosting jurisdiction, system, encryption posture] |
| Backup arrangements | [community-side, federal-side, redundancy] |
| Repatriation triggers | [event-based: project end, breach, withdrawal of consent] |

## USAI Considerations (Métis data)

> Apply only where Métis Nation populations are in scope. The Métis Nation OCAS / USAI principles (Utility, Self-Determination, Access, Inter-relationships) are distinct from OCAP and must NOT be conflated.

| Dataset | Métis Nation in scope | USAI principle applied | Status |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------|
| [dataset / ID] | [Métis Nation governing member: e.g. MNO, MNS, MNA] | [Utility / Self-Determination / Access / Inter-relationships] | [Confirmed / In progress / Not applicable] |

## ITK Principles Considerations (Inuit data)

> Apply only where Inuit populations are in scope. ITK *National Inuit Strategy on Research* (NISR) and Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee guidance govern; OCAP and USAI do NOT substitute.

| Dataset | Inuit population in scope | ITK principle applied | Status |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| [dataset / ID] | [Inuit Nunangat region: Inuvialuit / Nunavut / Nunavik / Nunatsiavut] | [NISR principle reference] | [Confirmed / In progress / Not applicable] |

## Data Sharing Agreement Terms

> Used where data is shared between the federal institution and a First Nation, Métis Nation governing member, or Inuit organisation.

| Term | OCAP-aligned commitment | Status |
|------|-------------------------|--------|
| Indigenous co-signatory | [named community signatory present] | [In place / Pending] |
| Purpose limitation | [explicit purpose, no broader use] | [In place / Pending] |
| Time bound | [start / end dates with renewal trigger] | [In place / Pending] |
| Revocability | [community right to withdraw with effect on data] | [In place / Pending] |
| Audit rights | [community right to inspect access logs] | [In place / Pending] |
| Sub-processor restrictions | [no onward processors without community consent] | [In place / Pending] |

## Repatriation Plan

> For data historically collected without informed consent, or data whose custodianship the community wishes to reclaim.

| Dataset | Historical context | Return / Destroy decision | Method | Owner | Date |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------|------|
| [dataset / ID] | [collected when, by whom, under what authority] | [Return / Destroy / Negotiated retention] | [format-portable export / secure destruction / negotiated co-custody] | [accountable role] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

## Co-Governance Arrangements

| Body | Indigenous representation | Decision rule | Appeal pathway |
|------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| [data-stewardship board / steering committee] | [number of seats / which nations / appointment process] | [consensus / majority / community-veto] | [escalation route — community → minister → independent review] |
| [working group] | [as above] | [as above] | [as above] |

## Risks and Mitigation Register

| Breach of trust through unauthorised disclosure | [Low / Med / High] | [Low / Med / High] | [community-protected classification; access logging; breach-notification clause to community] | [Low / Med / High] |
| UNDRIP Act misalignment | [Low / Med / High] | [Low / Med / High] | [Article 31 review; Crown alignment commitment; legal review] | [Low / Med / High] |
| Treating "Indigenous data" as a single regime | [Low / Med / High] | [Low / Med / High] | [maintain distinct OCAP / USAI / ITK tracks; separate engagement contacts per nation] | [Low / Med / High] |
| Conflict between federal classification and community protection | [Low / Med / High] | [Low / Med / High] | [community-protected override recorded in Document Control; Open Item raised] | [Low / Med / High] |
