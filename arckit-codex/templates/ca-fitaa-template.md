## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |

## Executive Summary

[Two to three paragraphs describing the project's exposure to FITAA, the registration model adopted, the public-vs-protected severance posture, and the headline Charter §2 risk findings. Note any statutory-currency caveats — section numbers or regulations that were `<TBC at draft time>`.]

## Activity Scoping

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Department / agency | [name] |
| Service / programme | [name] |
| Activities under review | [advocacy / convening / communications / engagement / etc.] |
| In-scope arrangements | [arrangements with foreign principals to influence government decisions / political processes / public discourse] |
| Excluded categories | [journalism, academic research, diplomatic activity — subject to standard FITAA exemptions, cite section `<TBC at draft time>`] |
| Decision-tree outcome | [REGISTRABLE / NOT REGISTRABLE / MIXED — explain] |

### Decision Tree (textual)

1. Is there an arrangement with a foreign principal? — [Y/N]
2. Is the arrangement intended to influence a government / political / public-discourse outcome? — [Y/N]
3. Does an exclusion apply (journalism, academic research, diplomatic activity)? — [Y/N, cite `<TBC at draft time>`]
4. Outcome: [REGISTRABLE / NOT REGISTRABLE / MIXED]

## Arrangement Register Design

| Field | Public / Protected | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|--------|-------|
| Registrant identity | Public | Registrant submission | Verified per workflow step 2 |
| Foreign principal | Public | Registrant submission | Identity verified |
| Activity type | Public | Registrant submission | Controlled vocabulary |
| Start / end dates | Public | Registrant submission | Material change → 14-day update |
| Financial flows | Public / Protected | Registrant submission | Public bands; granular figures protected |
| Investigative metadata | Protected | Commissioner / RCMP / CSIS | National-security exemptions per ATIP-Act §15/§16 |
| Severance map | Protected | System-generated | Audited per `ca-atip` rules |

Material-change cadence: registrants must update the register within **14 days** of a material change. The system MUST enforce a 14-day reminder + lockout if the registrant misses the window.

## Registration Workflow

| Step | Channel | Owner | SLA | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-----|-------|
| 1. Submission | Web (bilingual) / paper fallback | Registrant | n/a | Per `ca-ola` |
| 2. Identity verification | [identity proofing approach] | Commissioner's office | [SLA] | Risk-tiered |
| 3. Acknowledgement + registration ID | Email + portal | System | Same business day | Bilingual |
| 4. Public register publication | Web | System | Within `<TBC>` of acknowledgement | Severance applied |
| 5. Material-change update | Web | Registrant | Within 14 days of change | 14-day clock |

## Public Register vs Protected Investigative Data

    R[Registrant submission] --> V[Identity verification]
    V --> S[Severance engine]
    S --> P[Public register]
    S --> I[Protected investigative store]
    I --> C[Commissioner / RCMP / CSIS analysts]
    P --> X[Public website search]
```

| Severance rule | Field | Public outcome | Protected outcome |
|----------------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| National-security exemption | Investigative metadata | Suppressed | Visible to cleared analysts |
| Personal-information minimisation | Granular financial figures | Bands only | Full figures |
| Withdrawal | Withdrawn registration | Tombstone retained per `<TBC>` | Full record retained for investigative cycle |
| Correction | Erroneous fact | Public correction notice | Audit trail preserved |

Cross-reference `ca-atip` for the formal severance design and `ca-pia` for the personal-information minimisation rationale.

## Commissioner Liaison Protocol

| Trigger | Cadence | Contact | Artefact |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Suspected non-registration | Ad hoc | Commissioner's office (designated liaison) | Referral memo |
| Suspected falsification | Ad hoc | Commissioner's office + RCMP | Evidence package |
| Routine reporting | Quarterly | Commissioner's office | Quarterly compliance report |
| RCMP / CSIS coordination | Per `ca-soia` MOU | Departmental security officer | MOU + tasking record |
| Annual report contribution | Annual | Commissioner's office | Departmental return |

## Charter Risk Register

Cross-reference `ca-charter` for the full Charter §2 expression and association analysis.

| Charter section | Risk | Mitigation | Residual |
|-----------------|------|------------|----------|
| s.2(b) Freedom of expression | Chilling effect on advocacy / journalism | Tight scoping of registrable activity; journalism exclusion clearly applied; tombstone-only public record after withdrawal | [Low / Medium / High] |
| s.2(b) Freedom of expression | Over-broad public exposure of registrant identity | Severance engine; public bands not granular figures; option for protected-only registration in narrow categories `<TBC at draft time>` | [Low / Medium / High] |
| s.2(d) Freedom of association | Disincentive to legitimate diaspora / civil-society engagement | Clear public-interest framing; bilingual plain-language guidance; community-engagement plan | [Low / Medium / High] |
| s.2(d) Freedom of association | Disproportionate burden on small civil-society organisations | Tiered registration burden; small-volume exemption `<TBC>` | [Low / Medium / High] |

## Compliance Schedule (registrant-side)

| Trigger | Clock | Owner | Penalty exposure |
|---------|-------|-------|------------------|
| New registrable arrangement | 14 days from arrangement start | Registrant | FITAA offence §`<TBC at draft time>` — fine up to `<TBC>` |
| Material change | 14 days from change | Registrant | FITAA offence §`<TBC at draft time>` — fine up to `<TBC>` |
| End of arrangement | 14 days from end | Registrant | FITAA offence §`<TBC at draft time>` — fine up to `<TBC>` |
| False / misleading statement | At submission | Registrant | FITAA offence §`<TBC at draft time>` — fine up to `<TBC>` and/or imprisonment |
| Failure to register | Continuing offence | Registrant | FITAA offence §`<TBC at draft time>` — daily-accrual fine `<TBC>` |
