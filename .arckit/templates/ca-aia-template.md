## Executive Summary

[Two to three paragraphs describing the automated decision-making system, the decisions automated or assisted, the computed Impact Level (I, II, III, or IV), the headline mitigations triggered by that level (peer review tier, transparency notice, recourse), and the residual algorithmic-risk posture. Note any open peer-review nominations or pending reassessment items.]

## Levels I–IV Questionnaire Scoring

The Impact Level is determined by score across the six dimensions of the TBS *Algorithmic Impact Assessment Tool*. Each dimension is scored with evidence cited; the overall Impact Level (I, II, III, or IV) is computed from the totals per the Directive's threshold matrix.

### Dimension 1 — Project

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [project-scope question — e.g. is the project line-of-business or experimental?] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [project-scope question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Dimension 2 — System

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [system-design question — e.g. degree of autonomy, integration with downstream systems] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [system-design question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Dimension 3 — Algorithm

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [algorithm question — model family, explainability, transparency] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [algorithm question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Dimension 4 — Decision

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [decision question — reversibility, stakes, frequency] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [decision question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Dimension 5 — Impact

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [impact question — affected population size, vulnerability, severity] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [impact question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Dimension 6 — Data

| Question | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [data question — sensitivity, provenance, consent posture] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| [data question] | [0–N] | [reference / cite] |
| **Sub-total** | **[N]** | |

### Computed Level

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Raw score (sum of sub-totals) | [N] |
| Mitigation score (controls applied) | [N] |
| Net score | [N] |
| **Computed Impact Level** | **[I / II / III / IV]** |
| Threshold matrix reference | TBS Directive on ADM, current version |

> The questionnaire output is the source of truth. Self-declaring a lower level to avoid peer-review obligations is a Directive breach.

## Per-Level Mitigation Requirements

Mitigations below reflect the Directive's mandated requirements for the computed Level. Mark items not required at the computed Level as `N/A`; do not omit rows — reviewers expect to see the full schedule.

| Transparency notice (bilingual per `ca-ola`) | All Levels | [Published / Drafted / Pending] | [Service owner] |
| Pre-launch publication (≥30 days before launch) | III, IV | [Date scheduled / Pending / N/A at Level I–II] | [Service owner] |
| Human-in-the-loop design — override paths | II, III, IV | [Designed / Implemented / N/A at Level I] | [Service designer] |
| Human-in-the-loop design — escalation thresholds | II, III, IV | [Designed / Implemented / N/A at Level I] | [Service designer] |
| Quality assurance — training/test data validation | All Levels | [Complete / In-progress] | [Data steward] |
| Quality assurance — ongoing monitoring & drift detection | All Levels | [Operational / Planned] | [Operator] |
| Recourse mechanism — appeal to a human decision-maker | All Levels | [Designed / Implemented] | [Service owner] |
| Recourse mechanism — explanation rights | All Levels | [Designed / Implemented] | [Service owner] |
| AIA publication on Open Government portal | All Levels (default) | [Published / Pending / Exempt — cross-ref `ca-soia`] | [ATIP coordinator] |
