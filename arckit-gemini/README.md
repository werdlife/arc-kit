# ArcKit - Gemini CLI Extension

**Enterprise Architecture Governance & Vendor Procurement Toolkit for Gemini CLI**

ArcKit provides 69 slash commands for generating architecture artifacts, vendor procurement documents, and UK Government compliance assessments — all from within Gemini CLI.

## Agents

ArcKit includes 6 autonomous research agents that handle web-intensive tasks:

- **arckit-research** — Market research, vendor evaluation, build vs buy
- **arckit-datascout** — Data source discovery, API catalogue search
- **arckit-aws-research** — AWS service research (via AWS Knowledge MCP)
- **arckit-azure-research** — Azure service research (via Microsoft Learn MCP)
- **arckit-gcp-research** — GCP service research (via Google Developer Knowledge MCP)
- **arckit-framework** — Transform artifacts into structured framework

## Hooks

Automation hooks fire during your session to provide context and enforce standards:

- **Session Init** — Injects ArcKit version and project status on startup
- **Context Inject** — Adds project artifact inventory before agent planning
- **Filename Validator** — Validates ARC-xxx naming convention on file writes
- **File Protection** — Blocks writes to sensitive/protected files
- **Manifest Updater** — Updates manifest.json after writing project files

## Policies

Policy rules enforce extension safety:

- Prevent modification of ArcKit extension system files
- Warn when file content may contain potential secrets

## Theme

ArcKit includes a GDS-branded terminal theme using official UK Government Design System colors.

## Template Customization

Override default templates by placing customized versions in your project:

```bash
# Create override directory
mkdir -p .arckit/templates

# Copy and edit a template
cp ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/requirements-template.md .arckit/templates/

# Edit to match your organization's needs
# Commands will automatically use your override
```

Common customizations:

- Remove UK Government sections for non-UK Gov projects
- Add organization-specific Document Control fields
- Change requirement ID prefixes
- Add branding, headers, footers

```bash
# 1. Create project plan
/arckit:plan Create project plan for payment modernization with 6-month timeline

# 2. Establish governance

## MCP Servers

The extension bundles three MCP servers for cloud research:

| Server | Purpose | Auth Required |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| AWS Knowledge | AWS service docs, best practices | None |
| Microsoft Learn | Azure and Microsoft docs | None |
| Google Developer Knowledge | GCP docs | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

MCP servers are bridged via `mcp-remote` (requires Node.js).

## Alternative Installation: ArcKit CLI

The extension is recommended for all Gemini CLI users as it provides automatic updates and a clean zero-config experience.
